- [x] **Modifiers Indicators animation fix** Luna animation now respects CONFIG_NICE_OLED_WIDGET_MODIFIERS_INDICATORS_LUNA flag
- [x] **New macros** HID_HAS_ANIMATION, MODIFIERS_USE_SYMBOLS, MODIFIERS_USE_LUNA, MODIFIERS_USE_BONGO_CAT, MODIFIERS_USE_NONE for conditional compilation
- [x] **Changed default** CONFIG_NICE_OLED_WIDGET_HID_INDICATORS_BONGO_CAT from y to n (no animation by default)
